    Description: 
        Implement a standard trie for a set of ASCII strings including 
        a terminating character $ for each word. You might want to look 
        at the trie in zyBook. Create a class that has a constructor 
        that accepts the name of an input file as a parameter (a string), 
        and the class should have an operation that test whether a given 
        string is stored in the trie. The driver should allow user to 
        specify the input data file, output number of words in the trie, 
        and then use a y/n loop to check for a few words (try the 
        following words: honor, honour, government, computer). Output 
        yes or no for each search word. Use the text file usdeclarPC.txt 
        as an input file and you should format the words to lowercase 
        and remove extra characters like comma, periods, etc.

    I certify that the code below is my own work.

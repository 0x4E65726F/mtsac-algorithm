    Description: 
        Implement the MCP algorithm and print out resulting table as 
        well as the minimum number of operations. Try B x C x D with B 
        a 2x10 matrix, C a 10x50 matrix, and D a 50x20 matrix. Try 
        another test case with 10x5 (A), 5x2 (B), 2x20 (C), 20x12 (D), 
        12x4 (E), and 4x60 (F).

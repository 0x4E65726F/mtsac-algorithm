    Description: 
        Implement a shortest path algorithm for a graph (preferably 
        Dijkstra's algorithm) using AdjacencyListGraph class from 
        previous PA. Test it out using digraph above. Find the shortest 
        path from B to E using the weights below. Print out the path
        how to get from source vertex to a destination vertex.

    I certify that the code below is my own work.

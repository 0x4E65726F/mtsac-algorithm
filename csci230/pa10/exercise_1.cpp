    Description: 
        Implement Transitive Closure for a digraph using 
        AdjacencyListGraph class from previous PA. Test it out on a 
        simple example above (can assume each edge has a weight of 1). 
        Print both original digraph and updated digraph.

    I certify that the code below is my own work.

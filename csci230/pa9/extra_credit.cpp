    Description: 
        Set up code to represent an undirected graph using either a 
        simple matrix or adjacency matrix. There is no code for it, but 
        it should be straight forward with a simple matrix that stores 
        only 0 or 1. Try it out with the same two test cases in exercise
        1.

    I certify that the code below is my own work.

    cout << "Author: Nero Li\n";

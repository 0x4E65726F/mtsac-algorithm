    Description: 
        Implement either DFS or BFS using your graph class from exercise 
        1. You can set up DFS(G, v) like the book (perform DFS on a 
        graph) or G.DFS(v) where DFS() is a member of Graph class (use 
        similar set up for BFS). For C++, you can use Decorator.h and 
        DFS.h and use GaphAlgorithms.java for Java. Print out the 
        vertices and discovery/forward edges in the order that they were 
        visited (should be vertex, discovery edge, vertex, etc.). Try 
        the following graph and start out with vertex A.

    I certify that the code below is my own work.
